Project Title: "From Anomalies to Patterns and Predictions : A Comprehensive Data Analytics Approach on Transport for London using Unsupervised and Supervised Learning"

In this comprehensive data analytics project, I utilized unsupervised and supervised learning techniques to analyze Transport for London's ridership data (2018-2020). Employing clustering algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical dendrogram clustering, I identified distinct usage patterns and spatial distributions within London's transport system. Additionally, I developed predictive models, including a Linear Regression model to assess the impact of UK holidays and temperature on ridership, and a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) for transportation mode prediction, achieving a 93% accuracy. This research not only enhances our understanding of London's public transport dynamics but also provides valuable insights for transportation planning and infrastructure improvements globally.
